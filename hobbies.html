            <h2 class="hobby_title">Homebrewing</h2>
                <p>
                    I love to make my own beer. Since 2012, I've made over 150 batches of beer, 5 gallons at a time. Brewing started out as an exploration of how my favorite libation made and created, and has expanded into a creative outlet and ability to make to have my favorite styles always on hand and for cheaper.
                    <br><br>
                    When I started homebrewing, I used the extract method and pre-defined recipes from kits or the internet. After 12 batches, I went deeper into the hobby by creating an all-grain kit. All-grain is more similar to the way commercial batches are created and allows for more control and customization of the final product.
                    <br><br>
                    My process for making beer is as follows:
                    <ol>
                    <li>Recipe Formulation</li>
                        <ol>
                        <li> I determine the style of beer I want to make and create a recipe.</li>
                        <li>Once I've created my recipe, I'll need to gather the ingredients. In Chicago, Brew and Grow is a great shop and is located at Kedzie and Elston. Online, my favorite retailer is <a href="https://www.farmhousebrewingsupply.com/" target="blank">Farmhouse Brew Supply</a>. The type of beer I want to make will alter the amount and proportion of grain, hops, and water I'll need.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Strike, Mashing, Sparging</li>
                        <ol>
                        <li>Once I've built my recipe and have my ingredients, I'll start my brew-day by heating a pre-determined amount of water to a specific temperature. The amount of water I  need varies by the amount of grain in my recipe and it's temperature is determined by the style and how much body I want in the beer. If it's nice out, I'll brew outside on a turkey fryer burner. If its not nice, I'll brew on my stovetop.</li>
                        <li>When the water hits my target temperature, I pour the water into your mash tun with your grain and stir thoroughly. There musn't be any clumps of grain and all of it needs to get thoroughly wet. Once wet, the grain soaks in the hot water for an hour. <strong>This period is called the mash rest.</strong> Mashing is the process of extracting the flavors and sugars out of the grain which will later be converted to alcohol by the yeast.</li>
                        <li>While the mash rest is happening, I'll give it occasional stirs to ensure that I'm getting even extraction out of the grain. While the mash rests, I'll heat up sparge water. Once the mash rest is completed, I'll drain out the liquid from the mash tun, leaving the grain behind. The liquid is separated from teh grain by a screen on the valve, leaving just a sugar rich and flavorful liquid to drain. The liquid that comes out is called <strong>sweet wort</strong>. </li>
                        <li>Once the mash tun is drained, I'll add more water to the mash tun, give it a bit stir, and drain the liquid again. This process is called <strong>sparging</strong>, and it helps to rinse any remaining sugar that couldn't dissolve into the first running. Sparging helps ensure that I get the best use out of the grain I've selected and our beer ends up I envisioned. </li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Boiling, Hop Additions, and Chilling</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Once I've collected all of the sweet wort from the mash, its now time to bring the entire amount of liquid (usually around 6.5 gallons for a 5 gallon finished batch) to a boil. Boiling accomplishes a few things in the brewing process.</li>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Boiling pasteurizes the liquid, killing off any bacteria, wild yeast, or undesirable microbes.</li>
                                    <li>The act of boiling helps to drive off undesirable flavor compounds left behind from the grains.</li>
                                    <li>The oils and acids from hops are most volatile at a boil and helps them release their compounds.</li>
                                    <li>Lastly, boiling helps condense the liquid, raising its concentration of sugars.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>Once at a boil, I'll add my hops according to the schedule I've created in my schedule. Hops added closer to the start of the boil contribute only bitterness. Hops added towards the end of the boil, or after, add flavor and aroma.</li>
                            <li>After a 60 minute boil is completed, I'll run water through a copper coil. This acts as a heat exchanger, cooling down the boiled wort rapidly. A fast cool is helpful to preserve the aroma and flavor from late hop addition's, as well as quickly push the beer through the danger zone of microbe growth.</li>
                        </ol>
                    <li>Pitching Yeast, Fermentation, and packaging</li>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Once the wort is chilled, the actual beer making begins. Most of the flavor of the final product is created during fermentation.Yeast ferments the sugars created by the mash, creating alcohol, co2, and numerous flavor compounds that didnt exist in the wort. It's been said that brewers make wort, yeast makes beer.</li>
                            <li>I'll select a specific yeast strain of hundreds depending on the style of beer I want to create. The yeast chosen will have  great impact on its flavor, final ABV, body, and overall enjoyability. A single strain of yeast, in the absence of any competing yeast, microbes, or bacteria, is the most important component of creating an enjoyable beverage.</li>
                            <li>Once i've added the yeast, the wort will go into a small fridge, set to a specific temperature (usually in the 60s for an ale, 40's for a lager) that will help the yeast express itself without becoming stressed and creating undesirable flavors</li>
                            <li>After the yeast finishes fermenting the beer, I'll confirm its final sugar content and be able to measure its ABV. After the beer has finished fermenting, I'll transfer it to a small keg, purge any oxygen from the keg, and push c02 into the beer to carbonate it.</li>
                            <li>After a few days under pressure from co2, the beer is carbonated, and it's time to pull a pint and enjoy!</li>
                        </ol>
                    </ol>

            <h2 class="hobby_title">Ice Hockey</h2>
            <p>I've played Ice Hockey since I was in elementary school. I was never a good runner and didn't care much for football, leaving only a few sports left. I wanted to play hockey after going to a Blackhawks game with my dad when I was very young. I loved it.</p>
            <p>I played in house leagues as a child and then played in High School for Conant. For one season, I played wing, but other than that have always played defense. I like being able to stop people from scoring more than I like to score goals. AS I've gotten older, I find that helping the team prevent goals becomes more important than scoring.</p>
            <p>As an adult, I play on two teams at Johnny's Ice House in the C and C2 leagues. I've been on both teams for 10 years. It's been a great way to get exercise, relieve stress, and meet new friends. Aside from the time I stopped play after high school, this season that has been cancelled by Covid-19, is the longest time I haven't played. I can't wait to get back on the ice again. </p>

            <h2 class="hobby_title">Photography</h2>
            <p>Growing up, my mom was always taking pictures. She nearly always had a camera with her and would complete a a photo album showcasing the previous years achievements as a family. She used a point and shoot and was never technical about it, but she loved to capture moments and create memories for the family for years to come</p>
            <p>As I got older, I wanted a creative outlet, but was not a good painter or drawer. I was interested in the practical applications of photography from my mom, and thought that it would be a good way to be creative without having to use my hands. I got my first SLR before my sophomore year of high school in preparation for Photography class. It was the Canon Rebel G I admired of a friend from summer camp. I shot 35mm Kodak T-Max 400, Fuji Velvia, and Kodak Max color film on that camera through the end of high school. Like with hockey, I took a break in college as I lost darkroom access and things became increasingly digital.</p>
            <p>I picked up the camera gain in 2010 once I got a job that afforded me the ability to get a digital SLR. I bought a Canon 60d and slowly expanded my fleet of lenses. Over time, as my kit grew, I took it out less. I suffered from too much gear and a body that wasnt portable. In 2018, before a trip to Mexico with my wife, I traded in all of my canon gear that I barely used for a tiny Fujifilm mirrorless. I was hooked again. It's small size, but increase in image quality over the much bulkier canon let me bring the camera everywhere. </p>
            <p>In 2020, with the impending birth of my first child, Lucy, I started a 365 photo project and have taken and posted a picture every day of the year. This year has made me bring the camera to every event, on every walk, and always have it by my side. This year I moved away from editing RAWS and getting great jpg's straight out of the camera. The Fuji does a brilliant job of this and has greatly increased my love of photography and the speed at which i can post images. 2020 became a strange year to document, but this project allows me to have a photo from nearly every day of Lucy's life.</p>
