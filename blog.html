                <h2>1/1/2021</h2>
                <p>I've finished the portfolio site and I'm pretty happy with where its at for now. I think its clean and presentable and satisfies all the requirements of the pre-work guidelines. It's a shell, but I feel a lot more confident with the CSS and HTML stylings so far.

                I'm done with the coding challenges for the python pre-work and will spend the next couple days going over codewars, Jomaclass and practicing other python items.

                <h2>12/31/2020</h2>
                <p>I hope to get the site in mainly presentable order today, but only have a short period of time. Ive compressed nearly the entirety of creating the site to this week. It's been very difficult to juggle having a week off of work, wanting to help give my wife some space with Lucy, the demands of being with my parents in-law, and getting the pre-work done. I got next to nothing done the week of Christmas with more in-laws here. The juggle of time this week and Lucy's naps make me extremely nervous for how the next 10 weeks are going to go.

                <h2>12/30/2020</h2>
                <p>I made some good progress last night with making my hompage not looking like a total pile of shit. It's a much more simple image and title page, with links to the other content elsewhere.
                <br><br>
                This morning, I create a flexbox container for the hobby page to create evenly spaced columns for the listing of my hobbies. Also, I made a sticky navbar for my pages. 
                <br><br>
                7:23 and I'm pretty happy with my progress for the day. Built an about page, fleshed out the info in the hobbies section. Good work today!

                <h2>12/29/2020</h2>
                <p>I didn't get a lot of time to work on the site today with family commitements and the daily changes that occur at this house. Lucy was fussy all day, Felicity and Suzie thought they got covid. As a result, I took care of Lucy for a lot of my alloted worktime.
                <br><br>
                Onto productive things, I explored Flexbox and CSS grid today as alternate layouts for my page. I'm struggling with my page currently looking like a 12 year old designed it in the year 2002. I want it to look cleaner and nicer, but I have to remember this is my first attempt at a page, as well as im running wiht very little direction.

                Start something, iterate, improve. Lets get the bones stood up first.

                <h2>12/28/2020</h2>
                <p>Today I finished reviewing the HTML and CSS walkthroughs on w3 schools and really got to work on my page. I'm finding it hard to stay totally locked in on just reading through tutorials and need to be doing some code or watching tutorials and coding along with it to stay engaged.
                <br><br>
                The w3 School information will be, and is, highly valuable while going through creating, modifying, and styling this page. However, reading it peice by piece is slow going and tedious. As always, I learn by reading, doing, reviewing, and tinkering.

                I stil have lots of work to do this week and am excited to get started with Coding Temple in earnest.
                <br><br>
                Its 8pm and I'm back at it. There's a lot to get through and the CSS is complex. I still dont know exactly how I want the page to "look" and im finding that straight CSS and HTML is ugly!
